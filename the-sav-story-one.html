  <h2>The Savannah Story: I</h2>

  <p>
    It was November 1st, 2022, and my stomach dropped into a slow, sick roll. I gazed in horrified disbelief at the
    flight
    confirmation: November 5th. My phone's screen blurred as the room began to tilt. I was traveling from Phoenix to
    Savannah and the flight was booked for, of all the damn days, a date shackled to the symbolic imagery of The
    Collective.
  </p>

  <p>
    This felt less like an uncomfortable coincidence and more like a dare. <i>Remember, remember.</i> I began
    calculating the
    likelihood of being shoved into a black van by government agents, assassinated by cult operatives in the terminal,
    or
    publicly butchered by the Baker Boys the moment I deplaned in Georgia. But after a month in the White Mountains
    enduring
    BabaYaga's violent diatribes and threats, even a firing squad felt like a reprieve. If this was the end of the line,
    at
    least it was a ticket out of that cabin and away from the old woman's malevolence.
  </p>

  <p>
    I spent the next four days drenched in a suffocating anxiety, navigating the minefield of BabaYaga's unpredictable
    outbursts. When the fifth finally arrived, I descended the mountain towards Phoenix, my mind spiraling through the
    possible outcomes of this quest.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unsure if I would ever return, I arranged to leave my truck at Wingnut's apartment and summoned a car. On the drive
    to
    Sky Harbor, I was so mired in morbid thoughts I didn't realize the driver was speaking.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I'm sorry, what?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking up, I blinked and the terminal signs snapped into focus. He was asking for my airline.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Oh, umm…" I quickly double-checked my itinerary. "United."
  </p>

  <p>
    The driver whipped into the loading zone in front of the terminal with a practiced, aggressive grace. With a fluid,
    terrifying efficiency, he put the car in park, was out of the vehicle, and at the trunk before I could unfasten my
    seatbelt. I collected my luggage and offered a quick, firm handshake—his calloused hand providing a brief moment of
    human contact that felt jarringly normal. He was back behind the wheel and pulling away before my brain registered
    the
    thud of his door. <i>That's a man on a mission.</i> I stood on the curb, clutching my bag, and watched him disappear
    into
    the
    airport traffic.
  </p>

  <p>
    I inhaled deeply; the sharp tang of jet fuel and exhaust seared my nostrils. The concrete thrummed beneath me, a
    low-frequency shudder from unseen jet engines that I felt in my marrow rather than heard. Around me, the airport
    radiated; a stochastic squelch of voices swirled, anonymizing me.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a specific energy at airports, a gravitational potential generated by thousands of people suspended between
    their pasts and futures. It's a rare place where life feels surreal, composed of nothing but raw possibility.
    Despite
    the target on my back, a spark of genuine excitement flashed. I leaned into the moment and stepped through the
    sliding
    doors, letting the climate-controlled air wash over me.
  </p>

  <p>
    In November 2022, the world was trying to move past the pandemic, yet the social fabric remained frayed, a lingering
    irritability charging every public space. This palpable tension, the corralled nature of the terminal, and the
    ever-present surveillance of the security cameras were constant reminders that this could be a trap. I weaved
    through
    the crowd toward the security checkpoint, my eyes darting, looking for a tail or the glint of a weapon in the hands
    of a
    would-be assassin. Everything seemed normal, just another day at the…
  </p>

  <p>
    "Fuck you!"
  </p>

  <p>
    The shout ripped through the white noise like an explosion. My heart hammered against my ribs. <i>This is it.</i> My
    body
    tightened as I desperately scanned for a shooter or a blade-wielding attacker. <i>They found some nutjob to take me
      out
      before I even leave Arizona.</i> But the threat was localized elsewhere. A woman stood at a check-in counter, her
    body
    writhing in rage as she screamed at a motionless agent.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Call the police! Call TSA! Fuck you, bitch! I will beat your fucking ass!"
  </p>

  <p>
    She was still projecting profanities when two airport police officers materialized, flanking her and steering her
    toward
    the exit. The airline worker didn't even blink. She simply tilted forward slightly and spoke into the sudden vacuum:
    "Next in line, please."
  </p>

  <p>
    I exhaled, the adrenaline still surging in my blood. I pushed forward past the check-in counters and towards the
    security checkpoint, my hypervigilance now dialed to a deafening level.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I approached the gauntlet of metal detectors and X-ray scanners, my mind locked onto The Item tucked inside my
    carry-on. Approximately six inches long, three inches wide, and one inch thick—wrapped in thick matte-black
    packaging
    designed, I was told, to protect and obscure its contents. If it was discovered, it would surely provoke an awkward
    interaction with the Department of Homeland Security. Sweat coated my palms; a flash of heat climbed my neck,
    prickly
    and persistent. I had been reassured there was nothing to fear, but in my experience, reassurances were often polite
    fairy tales used to comfort children. I rehearsed my cover story—short, boring, and plausible—ready to deploy the
    moment
    things got complicated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within ten feet of the conveyor, a TSA agent materialized, unhooking a stanchion to open a new lane. She looked
    directly
    at me and motioned with her hand: <i>Come here.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    Kicking off my shoes and whipping off my belt, I moved with mechanical intent. I carefully placed my bag onto the
    conveyor and watched the black rubber flaps swallow it whole. Silently I pleaded with the universe for it to emerge
    on
    the other side without questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I stepped through the archway. On the other side, the agent waited with the wand, gesturing for me to "assume the
    position" and crucify myself. A secular crucifixion of vigilance: arms out and feet apart. She began a slow,
    methodical
    sweep. My heart skipped a beat when the wand emitted a sharp, metallic chirp near the base of my spine. I froze, the
    air
    turning to lead in my lungs. <i>Shit. The "tumor" next to my spine.</i> She frowned, swiped the device over the area
    again,
    and
    this time—silence.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You're good," she said flatly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Time didn't just slow down; it congealed. I stood at the end of the conveyor, my lungs locked, waiting for my bag to
    reappear. The static roar of the terminal muffled into a dull, underwater echo until my entire world narrowed to
    another
    TSA agent who was staring dead-eyed at the glowing monitor.
  </p>

  <p>
    The belt jerked to a halt. <i>Oh my God,</i> I thought, my heart stopping. <i>Is that my bag?</i> The agent leaned
    in and
    squinted
    at
    the screen that was displaying the tangled, chaotic contents of my carry-on. He hovered there for an eternity,
    seemingly
    contemplating a manual search. Finally, he tapped the controls. The belt groaned back to life. The world snapped
    back
    into existence, the fluorescent airport lights suddenly too bright as I finally permitted air back into my lungs.
  </p>

  <p>
    My hands were shaking slightly as I shoved my feet back into my shoes and fumbled with my belt; my skin crawled with
    the
    sensation of a thousand watching eyes. I snatched my bag from the rollers and didn't look back, heading deeper into
    the
    belly of the terminal towards my gate.
  </p>

  <p>
    I reached the gate just as the queue began to coil into a massive human serpent. I stood at the back of the line for
    a
    moment before the recollection hit: I'd been upgraded. The thought of business class offered a flicker of relief; at
    the
    very least, it meant more distance between me and any prying eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cabin was a hollow haven. The flight wasn't fully booked, leaving me with the entire row and a precious pocket
    of
    silence. I slipped into the oversized seat and let it devour my weary bones, the steady hum of the engines finally
    drowning out the frantic looping of my thoughts. For one solid hour, I would be entombed in this calming mortuary of
    solitude. I shut my eyes, drifting into a thin, nervous sleep to the rhythmic clinking of ice from the galley as the
    flight attendants began their service.
