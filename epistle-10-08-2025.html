  <h2>Epistle: The Weight of Worlds (October 6-8, 2025)</h2>

  <h3>The Geopolitical Monster</h3>

  <p>
    Six weeks ago I began an undertaking to write a "short essay" on the re-emerging multipolar world order. The
    research
    for it has metastasized into a 26-page monster of notes; a dense, sprawling chronology of global political structure
    since World War II, and often long before. The difficulty isn't just attempting to articulate five paragraphs of
    accessible comment on the situation; it's the total, terrifying immersion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Buried in this history, I have been genuinely horrified to witness the accelerating erosion of U.S. strategic
    advantages. This decline is not a sudden external shock but a self-inflicted wound, fueled by crippling domestic
    political polarization and the utter loss of a long-term strategic vision. The real torment is the apparent silence:
    the
    complete lack of expressed awareness from our national "leadership" that they even grasp the gravity of the
    situation,
    let alone that it requires immediate, adaptive action.
  </p>

  <p>
    All this high-level geopolitical anxiety is exhausting, proving that even the attempt to distill it into a few
    cogent
    paragraphs can drain a person. I am simultaneously trying to knit this massive collection of notes into a few
    meaningful
    pages while navigating life as a homeless writer. The constant, crushing logistics of being a person with no
    reliable
    place to be—the prioritization of laundry, food acquisition, and safe space—unrelentingly competes with the
    intellectual
    work.
  </p>

  <h3>The Bureaucratic Deception</h3>

  <p>
    Which is how I ended up here, at the library on a Monday morning, hammering out this small update. The guilt over
    the
    unfinished essay has become a lead weight—a pressure so heavy it forces me to file this piece of writing just to
    pretend
    I've accomplished something. It is a small, necessary bureaucratic deception against my own conscience.
  </p>

  <p>
    The essay still looms, the world is still burning, but perhaps a smaller, more immediate injustice can sustain me:
    It's
    October 6th, and still no word on the Book Club pick. "Announced October First" should mean October First. Proof
    that
    waiting for a woman is as much a fact as it is a sexist cliché. (The pick, I now realize, may finally be out. Small
    victories.)
  </p>

  <h3>The Chaos and the Calm</h3>

  <p>
    I did manage a small material victory on Tuesday: I got laundry done. I was quite relieved to find my only other
    pair of
    pants was not ruined by the half bottle of nicotine vape I spilled on them last month. It's a moment of small,
    bizarre
    relief in a world that increasingly looks less like a path to a meaningful future and more like a slow death from
    resource constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    That grim contemplation led me to the wildlife refuge at the beach. It is wild how quickly the summer came and went.
    The summer beach crowd has mostly cleared out, leaving the shore to a few outdoor enthusiasts and myself. I took off
    my shoes and
    walked
    along the sand, noticing the empty shells of horseshoe crabs scattered at the high-tide line—hollow traces of life.
    I
    found myself wondering how these alien creatures met their end. After my stroll, I sat, staring out at the immense
    ocean
    and the cargo ships on the horizon, contemplating my own smallness and immediate needs. When I got back to The Spot,
    I
    made a pretty good sandwich with the last of my zucchini and spam.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wonder if there will ever be a day when I feel competent as a writer.
