  <h2>Like An Animal</h2>
  <p>
    I woke with the thought scratching at my eyes, clawing its way from the back of my mind to the forefront: to die
    feral
    and alone, like a discarded pet dog that has outlived its convenience. It is an ever-present and inescapable
    possibility—a primal fear.
  </p>
  <p>
    And yet, I endure, not through inexorable pursuit, but by finding peace in the continual present—a truth that
    defies the
    animalistic dread. That is the essence of survival. It is a relentless cycle of securing sustenance, seeking
    shelter,
    and clinging to small joys that offer enough reason to keep going. This is life, distilled to its purest, most
    brutal
    facticity.

    Perhaps it is that existential terror that marks the human condition with a deep and perpetual hunger. Many are
    driven
    by an insatiable desire for more—more comfort, more status, more wealth, more power. This unrelenting pursuit, much
    like
    the plight of the traditional Buddhist “hungry ghosts”, is an endless merry-go-round of frantic hoarding and
    consumption. It is a futile attempt to fill a deep internal void. For the masses, this zombic chase leads to a life
    of
    deafening desperation.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is natural and fundamental to the human experience to have ambition, desire, and dreams, and to strive for a
    better
    life and world. However, destructive behavior emerges from the misconception that peace is a distant state, that
    contentment can only be found in an idealized hypothetical future. We convince ourselves that we are not yet whole.
    But
    the “future” is an elusive destination we will never reach; all we truly possess is the imperfect “now”. Our current
    actions may lead us to a different today, but once we arrive, a new tomorrow will continue to remain just beyond our
    grasp.
  </p>
  <p>
    The greatest treasure isn't found in a life of luxury or endless acquisition, but in the ability to be content in
    the
    present moment. This skill is more precious than gold, more brilliant than a diamond, and more comforting than any
    grand
    estate. Learning to cultivate contentment and be at peace with your circumstances, no matter how difficult, is an
    unparalleled superpower. It is the ultimate antidote to the gnawing fear of dying feral and alone—like an animal.
