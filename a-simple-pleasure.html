  <h2>A Simple Pleasure</h2>
  <p>
    In a world of endless streams of media strategically engineered to traumatize us into engagement by AI agents
    of doom,
    the value of simple pleasures has never been clearer. These are the small everyday moments that bring us
    genuine joy and quiet contentment, and are possibly too frequently taken for granted. For me, perhaps no other
    small act
    embodies this profound and consistent source of delight more perfectly than brewing and savoring a cup of
    coffee. Even now,
    penniless, homeless, and without community, that piping hot cup of black joy is a dark-steaming beacon, a
    reminder that
    moments of profound serenity can be found in the most desperate of times.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most days, provided I have the precious, enchanted beans to concoct the delicious energy elixir of life, my
    ritual
    begins by scooping the coffee grounds into my 24-ounce stainless steel Stanley camping cookpot with its
    strainer
    lid. I
    then pour in water, usually collected from the local library, and mix until I see no obvious signs of floating
    grounds.
    Finally, I light my propane camping stove, place the pot squarely on the burner, and utter the arcane druid
    incantation
    to summon the release of the dopamine-inducing magic, "Boil bitch! Boil! Woo!".
  </p>
  <p>
    As I carefully monitor the exothermic process that will yield my joy juice, my thoughts often turn inward: I
    ponder my
    navel, consider my own path through the chaos, and strategize how I might improve my fortunes. The moment the
    delightful
    brew begins to bubble gently, I swiftly cut off the stove and secure the strainer lid. With a quick tilt,
    being
    careful
    not to steam the flesh from my hand, I pour the means of my sanity and salvation into my 30-ounce stainless
    steel Atlin
    cup. For a brief, precious moment, a quiet certainty settles over me: "It's going to be ok."
  </p>
  <p>
    When my freshly brewed java is cooled to the point where I'm reasonably confident I won't give myself duck
    lips
    by
    imbibing, I begin the task of consumption. This simple act of relative normalcy allows me to empty my mind,
    open
    my
    ears, and feel the world around me. This is my favorite part of the day, when whatever chaos may haunt my
    present
    circumstances fades away. In this brief escape, I feel reconnected with a life that seems possible, against
    all
    odds.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I offer this thought, dear reader: in a world of constant technologically-enhanced chaos, the true
    rebellion
    is to
    seek out the essential quiet serenity of a simple pleasure. If you're willing to consider the advice of a
    homeless
    vagabond cast from society, I would encourage you to find your own. Disconnect completely from past and future
    anxieties. Sit in the present, even for a brief heartbeat, and truly enjoy life as it is. Because, believe me,
    you never
    know when everything may be gone and even the simplest of joys becomes a precious, distant memory.
